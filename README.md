# MVVM and Clean Architecture Android App

This Android application is developed using the MVVM (Model-View-ViewModel) architecture and follows the principles of Clean Architecture. These architectural approaches enhance maintainability, scalability, and code organization while promoting separation of concerns.

## MVVM Architecture

- MVVM separates the app into three main components: View, ViewModel, and Model.
- The View represents the user interface and displays data.
- The ViewModel holds the presentation logic and manages UI-related data.
- The Model handles the data, including data retrieval and business logic.

## Clean Architecture Principles

- Clean Architecture divides the app into distinct layers: Data, Domain, and APP.
- The Data layer handles data source interactions such as databases and APIs.
- The Domain layer contains core business rules and use cases.
- The APP layer presents data to the user, adhering to MVVM structure.

## Benefits

- Enhances UI responsiveness by isolating presentation logic in the ViewModel.
- Promotes maintainability and scalability by separating concerns.
- Minimizes dependencies between different components.
- Provides a strong foundation for feature development and updates.
- Isolates components for improved testability and easier updates.
